# Functional C#

Don't like to write the cumbersome declarations to satisfy the compiler over and over again. Therefore I hereby save my typings for future reference.

#### Todo's
* translate tests

#### Included is:
* a (trivial) latch to make sure code is only called once
* declarations for partial function application of functions
* declarations for currying
* an experimental implementation of the maybe monad

#### Not included is:
* a concurrent latch
* declarations for functions with more than n arguments
* some other things I missed
